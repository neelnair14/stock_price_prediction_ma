yea i uploaded the whole model online so you don't have to run it. but it is going to take a while to download

INSTRUCTIONS
1) extract zip file
2) enter terminal once inside file
3) if you don't have streamlit, "pip3 install streamlit"
4) "streamlit run app.py"
5) put in the proper stock ticker name into the input box and see how my model predicted the stock prices!
